# Machine Learning with Python

This repository contains the code for Machine Learning with Python, by IBM CognitiveClass. 

## About the course
This is a hands-on course on Machine Learning using *Python 3*. The course focuses on the basics of *Machine Learning* using *Python*. The following topics are addressed:

- How Statistical Modelling relates to Machine Learning and do a comparison of each.
- Real-life examples of Machine learning and how it affects society in ways you may have guessed!
- Hands-on: Use Python Libraries for Machine Learning

The repository contains *Jupyter Notebooks* on the various algorithms and models:

- **Popular algorithms: Regression, Classification, and Clustering**
- **Recommender Systems: Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering**
- **Popular models: Train/Test Split, Gradient Descent, and Mean Squared Error**

The code samples have been tested using Python 3.7.3

### Some important Python libraries

- NumPy
- SciPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Installation

If you have an existing Python 3.7.x installation on a Unix-like system, you can install the above libraries using pip:

```
sudo -H python3 -m pip install <Library>
```

In case you are running Python 3.7.x on Windows use:

```
py -3 -m pip install <Library>
```

Alternatively, you can install `Anaconda Distribution` for your particular platform
